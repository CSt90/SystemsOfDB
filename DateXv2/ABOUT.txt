This project regards the storing and viewing of products' expiration dates in a small grocery store.
Instead of using pen and paper to write down the expiration dates of each product, it is best to be stored in a database.

So the user stores the expiration dates of the products during or after receiving a bunch of products accompanied by a document. Expiration date and product description, as well as amount (optional), is registered manually. In addition to this information, the Supplier Name, document ID and delivery date are also necessary and registered manually of course. As for the product description mentioned above, the next step is to be imported via barcode search.

Apart from the registration of products and expiration dates, the user can add/remove suppliers, view expiration dates by supplier, document ID, or receipt date and filter out expired products if desired.

The last function of this project is to view and print products due to expire or having expired during a specific period, eg a month.

As mentioned before, barcode scanning for product entry is pending, as well as some basic statistics, so the user can see whether products are getting expired or being sold beforehand, in order to deceide whether and/or how much of each product to order next time.
