This project is my first step into web application/DB management. It was developed in a 7 month period, between two tourist seasons and finally shipped in May 2017.
Since then, many functionalities were intended to be added, some are working, others not so much. Plus many changes have been done since then, including a visual overhaul.
The idea was to transition many processes of the travel agency from analog to digital.
As I mentioned above there are some things that do not work correctly, but I haven't fixed them yet, because there's no time.
