This project is my first step into web application/DB management systems. It was developed in a 7 month period, between two tourist seasons and finally shipped in May 2017.
Since then, many functionalities were intended to be added, some are working, others not so much. Plus many changes have been done since then, including a visual overhaul.
The idea was to transition many processes of the travel agency from analog to digital.
As I mentioned above there are some things that do not work properly, but I haven't fixed them yet, because there's no time.

Long story short, this is a bus reservation management system. The user can add/edit/delete a reservation, bus, bus driver, excursion, etc.
In addition, buses can be assigned to specific excursions per date, so the user can see remaining available seats, even during the new reservation.
Management section includes invoices per reservation office, reservations cleanup, and database backup and restore.
Lastly, a pickup list for an excursion ordered by pickup times, based on the direction of the excursion, can be exported to excel, including total passengers number and total
Pay On Bus amount.
